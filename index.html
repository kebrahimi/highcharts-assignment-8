    <p>The United States has been affected by poverty increasing throughout the years. The last few years were updated by the United States Census Bureau on poverty thresholds. One, in particular, is below poverty, meaning if a family or individual is living below the poverty threshold, the family will be considered below the poverty line. There is a higher amount of below poverty line for female householders than males.
